# Object Recognizer 
The Bag-of-Visual-Words model (BOWV) is a traditional computer vision algorithm that uses image feature extraction techniques such as ORB and SIFT, and combines them with traditional machine learning models for object recognition. This approach is compared to using deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object recognition. The results of using the BOWV model and CNNs are then compared to determine which approach is more effective for object recognition. The results of this comparison provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches, and can guide future developments in the field of computer vision.
